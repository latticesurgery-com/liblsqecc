This package allows calling the Lattice Surgery Compiler's C++ edition, aka [Liblsqecc](https://github.com/latticesurgery-com/liblsqecc) from Javascript.

## Background on liblsqecc

The Liblsqecc package is part of the Lattice Surgery compiler project. It's a tool for quantum error correction, that translates an arbitrary quantum circuit into surface code operations based on lattice surgery. These instruction are expressed as a 3D array in JSON format. A viewer is available [here](https://latticesurgery.com/online-compiler).

## How to use this package

This package provides an interface to the Liblsqecc's executable target `lsqecc_slicer` though the `runSlicer` function. The type interface describes which options are available. For an overview of what the options do, please consult [executable's readme](https://github.com/latticesurgery-com/liblsqecc#the-lsqecc_slicer-executable).
